			<p>At the beggining of the weekend been working to make nicer panes for graphics. When i was looking for storys on my proyect tracking i saw accidentally:</p>
			<p><img src="daily-story-50-img.PNG" width="831" height="95" hspace="50"></p>
			<p>I decided it will be a composite relationship, editor-pane will set graphic-pane subject to it´s selected object. By default the graphic will be just the representation, but it could be modified to display any possible graphic for the editor-pane selected object.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h2>Design note: new graphic editors look</h2>
			<p>I changed graphic editors look for OpenGL visualization mode. They are very simple, they consist of the graphic and a three button toolbar. These two examples correspond to a map of the population fitness of three algorithm situations:</p>
			<p><img src="regression-tournament-001.PNG" alt="With tournament selection" width="253" height="241" hspace="20"> <img src="regression-random-selection-001.PNG" alt="With random selection" width="253" height="241">  <img src="graphic-editor-20-08-11.PNG" alt="Generational algorithm" width="253" height="241" hspace="20"></p>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>a. </strong>Map of population of a steady state algorithm using tournament selection (less diversity).</li>
			  <li><strong>b. </strong>Map of population of the same steady state algorithm, but switched to random selection (more diversity).</li>
			  <li><strong>c. </strong>Map of a population with a perfectly matching solution for regression problem.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Toolbar description:</h4>
			<ul>
			  <li><img src="graphic-editor-20-08-11-tool-1.PNG" width="25" height="20">Graphic class specifier button.</li>
			  <li><img src="graphic-editor-20-08-11-tool-2.PNG" width="22" height="20"> Graphic properties editor button.</li>
			  <li><img src="graphic-editor-20-08-11-tool-3.PNG" width="22" height="19"> Turn gaphic animation on / off.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h2>Documentation note: thinking about  examples</h2>
			<p>I been playing with some simple regression example, and thought it was a very well candidate for default documentation examples. It´s about searching for the function (+ (+ (* X X) (* 2 (* Y Y))) (/ Y 3)). In the next shot we can see different graphics for a run that found the desired solution in 56 seconds, and 2 executions later in 23 seconds:</p>

			<p>Example graphics for size and fitness, some population fitness map and the result found. I think a very good way to show experiments conclusions is using graphics, but still looking how can i show more things in fewer examples. </p>
